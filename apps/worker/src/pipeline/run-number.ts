/**
 * ═══ A RUN'S NUMBER WITHIN ITS TEST ═══
 * (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-27-run-number-design.md)
 *
 * "Run 12": the number a run takes the moment it JOINS its test, kept for
 * ever. Arrival order, deliberately — numbering by when a test ran would
 * renumber every later run whenever an old bundle is uploaded late, and "#12"
 * in last week's thread would name a different run today.
 *
 * A run's test is set in exactly two places, and so is its number, in the
 * SAME statement: `LiveFoldOwner#identify` at the log header
 * (`attachLiveRunToTest`), and `PipelineService` inside its finalize
 * transaction (`numberRunForTest`). The counter is `test.next_run_number`,
 * bumped by an UPDATE whose row lock serialises two runs of one test; a
 * max-plus-one read would hand both the same number.
 *
 * LOCK ORDER IS RUN, THEN TEST, in both statements and in
 * `TestRepository.remove`, so no two of them can deadlock each other.
 *
 * No backticks anywhere in the SQL below: it sits in template literals.
 */

/**
 * The live run's test, at its header — and its number, if and only if the run
 * had no test yet. A re-claimed fold identifies the run again; the EXISTS
 * guard is what stops that burning a second number (the second call blocks on
 * the row lock, re-reads test_id as set, finds "target" empty and allocates
 * nothing). Returns the number assigned, or null when nothing was.
